## Recommendations (Optional)

In this section, provide recommendations, related to controls and/or compliance needs, that your IT manager could communicate to stakeholders to reduce risks to assets and improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

Botium Toys should implement several key controls to strengthen their security posture and better protect sensitive information, including: enforcing Least Privilege, establishing comprehensive disaster recovery plans, updating password policies, applying separation of duties, installing an intrusion detection system (IDS), maintaining legacy systems regularly, using encryption, and implementing a centralized password management system.

To close gaps in compliance, the company should focus on controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. Additionally, properly classifying assets will help identify further controls that may be required to enhance security and ensure sensitive data remains protected.
